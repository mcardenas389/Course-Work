pgm.cpp

The purpose of this program is to perform simple algorithms to alter the appearance of a PGM (Portable GreyMap) file. 
A starting file, image_in.pgm, is needed to be loaded at the start in order for it to work. The first thing you'll see is a
menu of different algorithms you can perform on your basic image.

Note: The copy option doesn't do anything except for create another object within memory of the image file. It was never
implemented to do anything else.
